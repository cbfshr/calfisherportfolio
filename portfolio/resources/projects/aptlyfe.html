        <p>
            Aptlyfe is a personal project that I worked on over the summer. This single-page web application's intent was
            to aid me and my roommates before moving into our apartment. We ran into some planning issues where we weren't
            sure about who would be bringing what - and to make things even more complicated, one of my roommates is from Malaysia.
            Because of this, we had to keep track, not only of what we need to bring for us, but also for the apartment and
            for our roommate who would be coming with no furniture or anything. I came up with the idea, which became more
            realizable as I began to learn more about ASP.NET development during my internship with DuPont Pioneer.

            The application consists of a diagram of our apartment (created in Adobe Illustrator). It has an interactive hover
            feature, which allows the user to see which room is which, and the approximate shape of the room. Below the
            diagram is where the main functionality begins. If there are no items in the database, there will be nothing
            shown in the table, but when there is data, the user can see all the items in the apartment, including useful
            information such as the room it will go in, the owner, the category, and the status of the object (Do we have it?
            Do we need it?). A user should be able to add and edit existing entries, as well as switch to different ways
            of seeing the data (sorted by room or owner).

            When it comes down to it, Aptlyfe was a fun and interesting web application to build, which taught me a lot about
            setting up and managing a database, how to handle API calls and return the proper data (C# / ASP.NET), as well as
            integrating the front-end logic and interface (AngularJS, HTML, and CSS).
