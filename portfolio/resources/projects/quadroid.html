            With a little bit of reverse engineering, anything is possible!

        <p>
            Quadroid is a unique team project that consists of a Syma X11
            Quadcopter, an Arduino board, and a Nexus 7 Android tablet. The
            ambitious end goal of the project was to be able to control the
            quadcopter with the Nexus 7 tablet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The way we went about it was like this: we first needed to
            reverse-engineer the default RF controller for the quadcopter. Next,
            we needed to be able to emulate electrical signals that would normally
            be determined by the resistance of the joysticks. We connected wires
            to the Arduino board and directly soldered the other end of the wires
            to the controller's circuit board where the joysticks previously were.
        </p>
        <p>
            The picture to the left shows the wiring between the Arduino and
            controller circuit board.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other end of the spectrum, the Android application needed to do
            two things: emulate two joysticks and send the input information to
            the Arduino (using the Arduino Mega ADK). (Pictured to the left)
        </p>
        <p>
            From there, the Arduino could send the correct signals to the
            controller, which would then control the quadcopter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we got it working 100%, we were able to add a second flight mode
            to the Android application which allowed us to fly the quadcopter by
            controlling the roll and pitch with theaccelerometer values on the
            Android tablet. (Pictured to the right)

        <p>
            The project worked surprisingly well, and we went above and beyond the
            minimum requirements by implementing such a complex, reverse-engineered system.
