            After finding a few models on Thingiverse, I decided to modify them using Blender and print off Baby Yoda but also give him his own Mandalorian helmet!
            I also painted them using acryllic paint and chrome spraypaint for the helmet.

            Currently, the STL models are too large for hosting, so I'm planning to reduce the file sizes before uploading with a link to Thingiverse for each.
