            Another project started with my father, but this one took a while to complete. I initially messed up the epoxy pour for the back piece, which was a pretty big set-back.

            This is made out of two stained pieces of wood: we used a jigsaw to cut out the deer head outline on the front piece, and a CNC machine to router out the back for the bottle caps and epoxy.

            There is a programmable LED strip lining the inside, which is controlled by a custom circuit with an ATTiny microcontroller chip. I designed and 3D printed an enclosure for the electronics, shown below.
