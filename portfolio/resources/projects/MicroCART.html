        <p>
            MicroCART is a research-based senior design project focused mainly on the improvement of a quadcopter.
            The quadcopter has an FPGA board, which allows the team to program additional hardware
            and use low-level programming to take care of the basic quadcopter behavior.

            My responsibilities on the team include: Web Master and Ground Station Software. As Web Master,
            my job is to create and maintain a website that serves as a hub for all information about the
            project including Weekly Reports, Project Plans, and other important documents. The
            Ground Station Software is the software that runs on a computer with a Bluetooth connection to
            the quadcopter. This software is written in C and C++ (Qt) and is responsible for receiving information
            from a camera system (position coordinates), sending commands to the quadcopter, and logging information
            received from the quadcopter.

            Quadcopters are becomming more common in today's society. It's important
            to understand how they operate, and it's even more important to improve them so they can become reliable
            and safe. Here's an example of how quadcopters could be used in every day life...
