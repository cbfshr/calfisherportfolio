            <h2>Power - 600W Solar Roof and EcoFlow Delta Pro Power Station</h2>
            <div class="masonry">
                <p>
                    I've gradually been upgrading my solar setup since acquiring the GoFastCamper (GFC) and had visions of covering the roof with solar panels since I don't plan to use it for much else.
                    I started with 100W flexible solar panels, but the efficiency was so poor (even in direct sunlight) that I could barely charge my EcoFlow Delta Mini to run my camping refridgerator / freezer.
                    I decided I needed to upgrade to rigid solar panels and found a set of four 150W panels that when placed in a 2x2 grid had dimensions almost exactly that of the GFC roof!

                    At first, I only mounted two of these panels on the roof due to concerns about weight and a 300W input limit on my EcoFlow Delta Mini at the time.
                    I've since added the two additional panels and upgraded to an EcoFlow Delta Pro that is compatible with the potential 600W the solar panels can output!

                    The solar panels are wired in parallel, and the cable can be ran into the cab of the truck via the rear sliding window OR through a drain plug underneath the truck into the bed.
                    This allows me to be quite flexible with my setup over time. I can clear out the back seat if I am expecting passengers, and I can still have the set up reconfigured in the truck bed.

                    I use Starlink while traveling to remote areas if I am in need of a reliable, speedy connection to the outside world.
                    I designed this mount that will attach directly to the GFC's T-Slots and hold the Starlink high and proud while the tent is open or closed.

            <h2>Toyota Tacoma Bed T-Track Nut and Mounting Solution</h2>
            <div class="masonry">
                <p>
                    I have a collapsible ladder that I use primarily for getting in and out of the tent on the sides. (Fun fact: I can still get into the tent from the bed of the truck!)
                    When traveling, I didn't have a good spot to put the ladder. I figured the best place for it would be in the passenger side rear of the truck bed, mounted to the T-track; however, with the GFC mounted, I cannot slide the traditional T-Nuts designed for Tacoma bed rails.

                    I came up with a design for a rotating T-Nut design specifically for the Tacoma bed rails so that I could still manage to mount whatever I want, even with the GFC still installed.
                    This design is based on other common T-Nut designs out there in the industry.
                    Long-term, I would like to CNC this part out of aluminum, but high density and wall-count 3D printed PETG parts will suffice for now.

                    So far, I have mounted the collapsible ladder as well as custom Penny Board mounts in the bed of the truck!

            <div class="masonry">
                <p>
                    I designed and 3D printed a Molle panel mount for the Molle panel in the bed of my truck, so that I can mount anything I want to without worrying about purchasing them from elsewhere.
                    The design utilizes a brass insert.
                    Since the original design, I've made a few improvements, such as preventing the brass insert from being pulled out of the load-bearing side, as well as printing in PETG.

                <p>
                    I worked on a project with my cousin to build this upper shelf in the bed of the truck. This was an area where I tried to use a cargo net without much success.
                    We decided to build it using 8020 aluminum extrusions as well as a sheet of CNC'd pylwood to fit the 8020 frame.
                    This project turned out well, and I could even use the cargo net from before as a top restraint keeping blankets, chairs, etc secure and accessible.

                <p>
                    My dad and I decided to build a slideout kitchen for a semi-permanent and easily accessible kitchen storage solution for the bed of the truck!
                    As you might expect, this project can be used for storing many camp kitchen essentials, such as a two-burner propane stove, a refillable 5lb propane tank, utensils, silverware, pots, pans, fire starter, paper towels, cleaning supplies, pop-up kitchen sink, and so on.

                    It is mounted to the bed of the truck using a hefty turnbuckle, and the weight of the kitchen with all of the gear is enough to keep it in-place.
