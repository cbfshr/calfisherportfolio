            I have a white-throated mud turtle named Artemis! He's the chillest dude you'll ever meet. 
            While feeding him or cleaning out his tank, it became tedious to remove his heat lamp and 
            UV light from the tank cover, so I designed and 3D printed two parts that would keep these lights secured on the tank cover.
