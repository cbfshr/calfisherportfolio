            Here it is! A combination of AngularJS, HTML, CSS, and a little bit of
            love all wrapped up into one website!

        <p>
            I've been working on this website since college (around 2014) and have always wanted to continue improving every aspect of it.
            I'm currently rewriting the website entirely to improve a number of things like design, organization/file management, ease of deployment,
            adding newer projects, and more!
