        <p>
            I worked with my dad to create this mountain shape out of recycled barn wood. After the wooden moutains were pieced together, 
            I added a programmable LED strip, which is controlled by an Arduino UNO. Using the <a href="https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED" target="_blank">FastLED</a> library,
            I was able to program it to make each individual LED appear as if it were a snowflake falling in the mountain sky.
