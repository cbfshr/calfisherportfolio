            This project was a cross-collaboration with my cousin who was interested in learning how to program Arduinos and LED strips.
            His stairs were a perfect candidate for this project and would allow him to navigate his home easier at night.

        <p>
            We used an Arduino UNO, two PID sensors, and an LED strip like the one used in the <a href="" target="_blank">Programmable LED Mountain Lights</a> project.
