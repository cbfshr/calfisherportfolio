            <h2>Website Van Builder (Code Name: Configurator)</h2>
            <p>
                New Way Van Life is a van conversion company that changes the way van conversions are done. They have made a product that can be easily
                ordered, customized, built, and installed to the specifications of the customer. They use a highly configurable layout scheme using 
                <a href="https://8020.net/" target="_blank">8020</a> extruded aluminum bars to build the structure of the van. After that, any furniture, 
                electronics, showers, sinks, and storage can be added as needed by the customer.
                The van conversion can also be as simple as just doing the walls, a floor, and a ceiling. This allows the customer to start with a blank slate: a relatively cheap 
                van conversion kit that they can build to their own liking using the widely available 8020 system or by buying New Way Van Life products further down the line.
            </p>
            <p>
                I helped the New Way Van Life team build a van conversion configuration tool for their website.
                They dubbed it the "Configurator" or "Van Builder", which is intended to be a one-stop-shop for a customer to build a custom Sprinter
                Camper Van layout on the website and receive an estimated breakdown of the cost in their email.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                I worked with the co-founder of the company and another web developer to identify the end goal of "Phase 1" or the "MVP" (Minimum Viable Product) of the van builder with a two month timeframe ("deadline") before their next trade show.
                I used ClickUp to break down the overarching goals of the project into smaller, bite-sized tasks that I could then distribute between myself and the other web developer.
                The website uses Vercel and Next.js, which I had never worked with before; however, I was able to get up-to-speed quickly to complete the tasks effectively and efficiently.
                I worked on various tasks, such as adding the header with step navigation, adding the estimate submission form, sending emails via Form using Resend and React Email 
                Templates, and implementing other UI/UX improvements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea of the project was simple: showcase the value and functionality of the product in a user-friendly UI/UX focused way. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A potential customer only has to do the following three things to get started...
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 1:</b> Pick the selections you want to build your own custom van layout.
                <br />
                <img src="resources/images/projects/new_way_van_life/nwvl-van-builder-furniture-screenshot.png" class="center" style="max-width: 1280px;" />
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 2:</b> Enter your name, email, and phone number in the estimate modal to receive a detailed estimate in your inbox.
                <br />
                <img src="resources/images/projects/new_way_van_life/nwvl-van-builder-estimate-screenshot.png" class="center" style="max-width: 1280px;" />
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 3:</b> Review your estimate email and contact New Way Van Life to continue the process of building your dream van!
                <br />
                <img src="resources/images/projects/new_way_van_life/nwvl-van-builder-email-screenshot.png" class="center" style="max-width: 600px;" />
            </p>
            <p>
                There are more improvements we'd like to implement as time allows to improve the overall functionality and user experience, as well as maximize the marketing effectiveness of the tool.

            <h2>Photography</h2>
            <p>
                I have also been a part of several photoshoots for newly completed vans to help expand their photography portfolio for the website, social media,
                and other marketing materials. Take a look at some of the photos I've captured to date...
