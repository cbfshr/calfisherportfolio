                    Hey there, welcome to my site! Feel free to take a peek around - I gave my best effort to reflect who I am and what I'm passionate about through this site.
                    I'm currently a Site Reliabiltiy Engineer at Oracle Health (formerly Cerner) working on Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
                    to improve engineering effectiveness. This primarily consists of designing and maintaining delivery pipelines
                    for hundreds of Java services and Rails applications as well as managing <a href="https://www.spinnaker.io/" target="_blank">Spinnaker</a>, a
                    multi-cloud delivery platform. These pipelines automate several repetitive manual tasks in the delivery process that allow engineers to focus on development rather than operations.
                    Automation is core to my recent professional background, but I also have experience with developing services and big data pipelines!
