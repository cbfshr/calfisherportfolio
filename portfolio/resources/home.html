                    Hey there, welcome to my site! Feel free to take a peek around - I gave my best effort to reflect who I am and what I'm passionate about through this site.
                    I'm currently a Site Reliabiltiy Engineer at Cerner working on Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
                    to improve engineering effectiveness. This primarily consists of designing and maintaining delivery pipelines
                    for hundreds of Java services and Rails applications as well as managing <a href="https://www.spinnaker.io/" target="_blank">Spinnaker</a>, a
                    multi-cloud delivery platform. Automation is core to my operational background, but I also have experience with developing services and big data pipelines!
